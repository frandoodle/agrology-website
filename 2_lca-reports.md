Have you been asked to submit a Land Capability for Agriculture (LCA) report? LCA classification is based on the soil's limitations for agricultural use. 

Assisi Agrology is highly experienced in conducting LCA assessments. First, we perform a field assessment on the land in question, including testing of drainage, soil texture, fertility, stoniness, etc. That data is then used to complete the report.

More information about LCA classes can be found here: [Agricultural Capability Classification in BC (www.alc.gov.bc.ca)](https://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/assets/alc/assets/library/agricultural-capability/agriculture_capability_classification_in_bc_2013.pdf){:target="_blank"}
