Soil Carbon Project Consulting

-->


**Soil Carbon Projects**
***What is a soil carbon project?***
- What can soil carbon projects do for communities?
- (Tangible benefits - who benefits)?
- How are they done?


As a carbon project development consultant, I will work closely with project developers to support project design, draft project documents, and ensure all deliverables meet the requirements of the relevant carbon standards and safeguard frameworks.



***I provide:***
- Feasibility analysis
- Project partnership
- Project documentation + monitoring reports
- Land cover change assessments
- Tree growth and carbon modelling
- Biodiversity monitoring
- Livelihood and socioeconomic assessments
- Stakeholder engagement with free, prior, and informed consent
