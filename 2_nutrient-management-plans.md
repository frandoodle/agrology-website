In British Columbia, NMP requirements are being gradually rolled out for farms based on factors such as location, operation type, and soil test values.
Nutrient Management Plans (NMPs) aid farmers in optimizing production and environmental protection. These plans offer tailored recommendations to advise farmers on appropriate nutrient sources and application rates.

More information about NMPs can be found here: [Nutrient management plans
