For example, the code GB15300120 on a digital geographic feature links it to the name " Lake - Dry" with the definition "A lake bed from which all water has drained or evaporated." The feature code does NOT mark when it was digitized, what dataset it belongs to, how accurate it is, what it should look like when plotted, or who is responsible for updating it. It only says what it represents in the real world. It also doesn't even matter how the lake is represented. If it is a very small lake, it may be stored as a point feature. If it is large enough to have a shape at the scale of data capture, it may be stored as an outline, or a closed polygon. The same feature code still links it to the same definition.</td>
