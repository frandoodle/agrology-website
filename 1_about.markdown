## Who We Are

## What We Do

## Why We're Different -->

Assisi Agrology was founded by Francis Durnin-Vermette to serve small- to mid-sized property owners facing environmental bylaw challenges in BC.
Larger environmental science firms prefer to handle clients with large development plans and deep pockets.

Every situation is different. When our clients hire us to untangle the policy particulars of their property, we do not just tell our clients what is happening; we support them throughout the entire process from start to finish.

At Assisi, our motto is: "No problem is too big, or too small."
