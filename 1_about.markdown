List of my publications

Right column:

I am a professional soil scientist with specific expertise in soil carbon.
My mentor, Dr. Adam Gillespie, is an expert in soil carbon characterization - my interest is in soil carbon quantification.

I have over 8 years of experience in environmental science, and I have worked on soil carbon projects for both federal and provincial governments.

In July 2023, Evelynn Hamilton told me there was a gap I could help fill: small communities were reaching out to her for help with their budding carbon projects.
Larger carbon consulting firms would never take these communities as clients because they are already at capacity working on multi-million dollar international carbon projects.
I am a lot more satisfied when I see the positive local impacts of small communities reaching their goals.
As an independent consultant, I am in the perfect position to help small communities with their carbon projects.

I am able to offer:
- Products tailored to the specific needs of the client
- Honest, open, and reliable communication
- Rigorous carbon quantification
