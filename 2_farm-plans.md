Farm plans are required by many local governments to demonstrate the capacity for achieving farm status. Assisi Agrology is well-versed in drafting farm plans for the City of Richmond and other municipalities.

Farm plans generally include details on unimproved/improved agricultural capability, soils, drainage and irrigation, proposed farm operator, as well as an estimate of agricultural improvement costs.

Many farm plan submissions also provide a rationale for any proposed agricultural structure (e.g. a barn), outlining its proposed use, location, and size in relation to the planned farm business.
